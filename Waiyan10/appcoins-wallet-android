Welcome to AppCoins Wallet's open source Android app!

## Getting Started

1. Install latest Android Studio (>=3.0.0).
2. Clone this repository.
3. Build and run.

## Contributing

As an open source project, it is our intention that this project may receive 
contributions from the community. Ultimately, our goal in the AppCoins is to build
technology that is useful to our users.

In order to submit feedback and report bugs, we consider the best way is to open 
a GitHub issue. Whenever you do it, we ask you to include all relevant information
that will enable us and other users to replicate bugs, such as device, Android version,
and steps to reproduce the reported bugs.

## Credit

We forked the [Trust Wallet](https://trustwalletapp.com) for Android project to bootstrap the ASF wallet development. We considered it the best alternative regarding already implemented functionalities and forked it with the intention to contribute back with implementations and work that would be considered relevant.
